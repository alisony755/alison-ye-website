In my role, I grouped and filtered the dataset to identify the top 5 pharmaceutical companies by Medicaid spending received in 2022. To forecast future trends, I applied a simple linear regression model to predict Medicaid spending from 2025 to 2026. I visualized these insights using Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib to clearly communicate patterns and projections.",
