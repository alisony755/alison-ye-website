          <p>
            I am a driven third-year computer science student at Northeastern University, specializing in Artificial
            Intelligence with a deep interest in inclusive and user-centered design. I am passionate about leveraging
            technology to create innovative solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly those that
            empower underrepresented groups and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on developing a strong problem-solving mindset, which I have
            applied to both individual projects and team initiatives. I believe in the power of technology to not only
            innovate but also to foster inclusivity, making it accessible to all users, regardless of their backgrounds
            or abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
          In addition to my academic work, I am actively involved in creating opportunities for others to explore STEM
          fields. I am currently the Design Lead for ACM @ Northeastern, a computer science professional organization, 
          where I manage social media content and branding. I am also a member of FirstByte, a Northeastern student 
          organization that offers tech workshops for local students, helping to increase diversity and representation 
          in these fields. My dedication to both personal growth and community outreach reflects my long-term goal of 
          using my skills to make a tangible, positive impact on the world.
