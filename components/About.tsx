        <p>
          I am a driven third-year computer science student at Northeastern University, specializing in Artificial
          Intelligence with a deep interest in inclusive and user-centered design. I am passionate about leveraging
          technology to create innovative solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly those that empower
          underrepresented groups and communities. Although I am still building her expertise in coding, machine
          learning, and databases, I am eager to expand my knowledge and apply my skills in meaningful ways.

          <br />
          Throughout my academic journey, I have focused on developing a strong problem-solving mindset, which I have
          applied to both individual projects and team initiatives. I believe in the power of technology to not only
          innovate but also to foster inclusivity, making it accessible to all users, regardless of their backgrounds or
          abilities. I have taken classes where I studied, and I am continuing to learn outside of school, how to make
          technology more inclusive.

          In addition to my academic work, I am actively involved in creating opportunities for others to explore STEM
          fields. I am a member of FirstByte, a club that offers tech workshops for high school students, helping to
          increase diversity and representation in these fields. My dedication to both personal growth and community
          outreach reflects my long-term goal of using my skills to make a tangible, positive impact on the world.
