## Accessibility Goals

Accessibility is a core priority of this site. Design choices were made to improve usability for individuals with a range of needs, including visual and cognitive differences. Enhancements currently being implemented aim to bring the site closer to **WCAG 2.1 compliance**.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Built a modular, component-based UI with reusable logic and state management using hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe development with strongly typed components and props
- **Next.js 14**: Leveraged the App Router for file-based routing and modern React features
- **HTML5 (JSX/TSX)**: Structured semantic markup written in JSX/TSX, ensuring accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and roles
- **CSS3**: Applied global styling with custom CSS, featuring responsive grid layouts, smooth animations, and accessibility-focused design (high contrast mode, dyslexia-friendly fonts)

### External Libraries
- Google Fonts (including OpenDyslexic)  
- Font Awesome  
- Material Symbols  

**Deployment:** Netlify

## Future Plans

- Improve keyboard navigation support across all interactive components  
- Integrate speech synthesis (text-to-speech) for key sections  
- Add more color themes to cater to different user needs
